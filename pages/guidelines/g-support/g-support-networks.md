## Context
Data stewards play a central role in enabling FAIR research, yet often find themselves isolated within their institutions. Participation in expert networks — locally, nationally, and internationally — is essential for knowledge sharing, professional support, and staying current with standards, tools, and practices. These networks serve both operational needs and long-term community building.

Data stewardship is not a solitary pursuit, but it can easily become one. Many stewards are the only ones with relevant expertise in their team or institution. Without structured opportunities for exchange, they risk working in silos, duplicating efforts, or missing key developments. Each level of networking offers distinct benefits: local networks connect stewards to institutional culture; national networks align stewardship with infrastructure and policy; international networks link them to innovation and global communities such as ELIXIR and the RDA. A balanced presence across these levels strengthens both individual practice and institutional capacity.

However, participation alone is not enough. The degree to which an organisation supports such engagement — by providing time, budget, or strategic encouragement — signals its commitment to responsible, collaborative research. Institutions that invest in network involvement demonstrate that they value the professional growth of their stewards and the broader impact of coordinated data management.

## Guidelines
The following tips support data stewards and their institutions in progressing along the maturity indicator for expert networks. They are organised around three core drivers: institutional support, strategic engagement, and meaningful contribution — aligned with both Node feedback and the broader RDM maturity framework.

### Build institutional support and recognition

1. Get leadership on board
Demonstrate how networking contributes to service quality, professional growth, and alignment with national and international infrastructures. Highlight the strategic role of data stewards in embedding FAIR practices.
2. Formalise support
Encourage your organisation to create clear mechanisms:
* Allocated time for participation
* Budget for travel or contributions
* Reporting or reflection loops to track network engagement

### Strategically choose and balance your networks

1. Map out your engagement across levels
Aim to participate in:
* Local networks for institutional alignment and peer support
* National initiatives for infrastructure, training, and policy
* International forums for trends, standards, and community leadership
2. Prioritise structured networks
Focus on communities with working groups, defined outputs, and coordination roles.

### Meaningfully contribute to networks

1. Show up and share
Bring practical examples, tools, or challenges. Attend meetings, share what works (and what doesn’t), and promote your institution’s practices.
2. Take initiative
Join a working group, help organise a session, lead a project, or contribute to a shared output.
3. Reflect and amplify
Use network outputs locally (e.g. new policy or tool), then share back what you did. This closes the loop and shows the value of participation.

### Help informal networks mature

1. Support structure-building
If you’re in a grassroots network (e.g. Slack, breakfast group), propose light coordination: rotating chairs, agendas, notes.
2. Use frameworks to guide growth
Apply tools like the Community Canvas or CSCCE models to clarify roles, identity, and sustainability.
