## Context

Effective RDM relies on the consistent use of data and metadata standards, policies and best practices. Guidance and training materials are essential for understanding and applying these principles, yet finding relevant, high-quality and up-to-date resources can be difficult. 

It’s not enough for training materials to simply exist. Good materials go beyond slide decks; they include metadata, update history and information on authors and maintainers. Additionally, FAIR materials save time, support consistent practices, and help stay aligned with evolving standards, tools and community expectations. They also help recognise the people who create and sustain them. 

Institutions that invest in creating, maintaining and promoting FAIR training materials show a commitment to responsible and sustainable research practices. At the institutional level, training materials support staff and researchers and help strengthen local data stewardship capacity. At the national level, shared training materials allow broader adoption, community alignment, and contributions to national infrastructures. In both cases, the quality, findability and reusability of materials determine their actual value and impact. Data stewards have practical tools, researchers gain skills and institutions strengthen their research data ecosystem.

## Guidance

The following tips support data stewards and their institutions in improving the availability, accessibility, and FAIRness of RDM training materials. They are organised around four core drivers: strategic planning, FAIR, quality assurance, and sustainability.

### 1\. Plan strategically for material availability

✔ **Identify target audiences and purpose**

Identify target audiences for the training materials, such as , data stewards, researchers, technical staff, or administrators and clarify the intended purpose. Define learning outcomes, expected reuse scenarios, and visibility goals before producing and publishing materials.

**✔ Integrate into institutional workflows**

Integrate the publication and availability of training materials into regular training process:

* Ensure content created for courses is deposited immediately after delivery  
* Align publication with research milestones, onboarding, or grant deadlines  
* Include material availability in internal reporting

### 2\. Deliver materials in FAIR and accessible formats

**✔ Apply FAIR principles**

Ensure materials are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable:

* Include metadata (title, audience, duration, learning outcomes, license, language, version/date)  
* Use standard formats and adhere to structured file naming conventions

**✔ Choose the right platforms**

Publish materials in locations where target users can easily find them and are likely to look for them:

* Institutional repositories or intranet portals  
* Community registries such as [TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/)  
* Open-access platforms like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/)

✔ Provide multilingual versions when possible

English ensures wider visibility, and local languages increase accessibility for internal staff.

### 3\. Maintain quality and visibility

**✔ Regularly update content**

Review and refresh materials at least annually, or whenever tools, policies, or best practices are updated. Include updates as part of standard course maintenance workflows.

**✔ Track impact and reuse**

Collect usage data (downloads, views, citations) and participant feedback to guide updates and demonstrate successful adoption.

**✔ Promote actively**

Use multiple channels to enhance visibility, including newsletters, intranets, mailing lists, social media, and partner networks. Promotion is as important as publication.

### 4\. Ensure sustainable maintenance

**✔ Clarify responsibility**

Define who owns, maintains, and updates each set of materials. Include guidance on continuity and substitution  in case the original creator leaves.

**✔ Encourage reuse and collaboration**

Adapt and reuse existing open resources to save time, comply with FAIR principles and align with community standards. Contribute any improvements back to repositories or registries to support collaborative improvement.

**✔ Document and index**

Ensure materials are discoverable by indexing them in institutional catalogues, course listings, or community registries, with clear links and persistent identifiers (e.g., DOI).
