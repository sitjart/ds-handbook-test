## Context

A research data management (RDM) infrastructure is the combination of services, technologies, policies, and support needed for handling research data. It covers the entire [data lifecycle](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_life_cycle) from planning, collecting, processing and analysing to preserving, sharing and reusing. The infrastructure provides the basic environment in which researchers can manage their data responsively.

In many organisations, some services exist but are not connected or formally supported. Researchers may have access to storage, data transfer or manuals, but there is no clear ownership,  documentation or established process to obtain support. As a result, users often need to rely on colleagues or ad hoc solutions, leading to inefficient support with services of varying quality.

Formalisation of an RDM infrastructure means mapping services and processes, assigning owners, and identifying gaps to ensure that ready-to-use approach is available to support users when they encounter problems or have questions. This includes not only the services and processes themselves, but also the associated documentation, templates and support channels. Institutions can then prioritise which gaps to fill first and create a roadmap for action.

A formal infrastructure makes services visible and reliable, reduces duplication, and builds trust. It also ties the services to funder requirements and institutional policies, making sure requirements are not handled ad hoc.

## Guidance

A strong RDM infrastructure relies on clear responsibilities, effective coordination, and steady improvement. The following guidance help institutions move from scattered tools to a connected and well-supported system. The focus is on **mapping**, **coordination**, **evaluation** and **sustainability** as the foundations of professional RDM support.

### 1\. Map existing services and responsibilities

**✔ Create an overview** 

List all existing and planned RDM services that support the entire data lifecycle, from planning and collection to preservation and sharing.

**✔ Assign ownership**

Identify a person or team responsible for each service to ensure continuity and accountability.

**✔ Document access and use** 

Record how services are accessed, what documentation or tools are available and who uses them. This helps expose overlaps and gaps across teams or systems.

**✔ Capture dependencies** 

Note how services relate to one another to clarify where coordination or integration is needed.

### 2\. Define and connect workflows

**✔ Link related services** 

Describe how researchers move through the data lifecycle, for example, from DMP creation to secure storage or publication and what services are used at specific stages.

**✔ Coordinate across teams** 

Align processes among RDM, IT and library staff to ensure clear handovers and consistent support.

**✔ Provide a single access point** 

Provide a single visible entry point for questions or requests, such as a shared inbox or help desk, to make it easy for researchers to find information and support.

**✔ Promote communication and visibility** 

Share updates about available services and make support channels easy to find and well-disseminated.

### 3\. Identify and address gaps

**✔ Review completeness** 

Check which elements are missing, such as documentation, templates or assigned contacts.

**✔ Collect feedback** 

Ask users and support teams where they face obstacles, confusion or duplication of effort.

**✔ Assess relevance and usability** 

Ensure that documentation and tools meet researchers’ real needs and are easy to follow.

**✔ Prioritise improvements** 

Focus on actions that bring the greatest impact, meet compliance requirements or can be implemented quickly with existing resources.

### 4\. Plan and sustain improvement

**✔ Develop a roadmap** 

Outline the  short-, medium-, and long-term goals with clear actions, timelines and responsibilities.

**✔ Monitor progress** 

Use review cycles, feedback, and usage data to monitor performance and to  identify emerging needs.

**✔ Ensure long-term support** 

Link infrastructure maintenance to institutional policies, funding and strategic plans to keep services reliable and sustainable.

**✔ Evaluate regularly** 

Schedule periodic reviews to check whether improvements are effective and whether new gaps appear as services evolve.

*These steps align with frameworks such as the [LIBER–ADBU Toolkit for RDM support services](https://libereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/Liber_ABDU1920X1080_FINAL.pdf) and the [University of Oxford’s roadmap for RDM development](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358641275_To_protect_and_to_serve_developing_a_road_map_for_research_data_management_services), which both emphasise mapping, coordination, and continuous improvement as key stages in building sustainable RDM support.*
