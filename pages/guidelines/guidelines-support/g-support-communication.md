### 2. Encourage feedback and demonstrate change


#### Invite questions proactively

Include feedback prompts in emails, presentations or onboarding slides to make asking questions feel normal.


#### Track what comes in

Use a simple format to log input and improve consistency over time, such as a shared spreadsheet or form.


#### Dedicate time to follow up

Set aside hours specifically for responding to questions and reflecting on service quality.


#### Communicate visible change

Let researchers know when their input results in updates to templates, guidance or policies. 


#### Use patterns to strengthen support

Recurring questions can highlight unclear guidance or missing resources. Use them to guide improvements.


#### Share back through existing channels

Utilise the channels that you found researchers already use to share the changes implemented from their feedback.
