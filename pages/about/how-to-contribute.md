<p class="section-eyebrow"> FOR CONTRIBUTORS</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The handbook is built by data stewards, for data stewards. Every signpost, campfire, and waypoint comes from someone who's done the work and decided to write it down. If you've got a story, a pattern, or a hard-won lesson – we'd love to add it.</p>

This page walks you through what we're looking for, how to write in the handbook's voice, and how to actually get your contribution on the site.

{% include callout.html type="magpie" content="The handbook is open. There's no editorial board approving topics top-down – if a chapter is missing or thin, you're invited to fill it in." %}

## Who we're looking for

Three kinds of help, all welcome:

- **Writers** – data stewards (any level) with experience to share. You don't need to be senior to contribute. Often the most useful pages come from people who learned something the hard way last week.
- **Reviewers** – people who can read draft pages and tell us what's missing, unclear, or wrong. You don't have to write to help.
- **Designers and developers** – anyone who can improve the look-and-feel, accessibility, or tooling of the site itself.

## Pick your contribution

You can write in any of the three landmarks (or all of them, over time):

### 🪶 Write a Signpost

Step-by-step practical guidance on something you do – *"how to set up an institutional DMP service"*, *"how to run an RDM intake meeting"*. Signposts are the most-read content because they're often what data stewards open Google for. If you've solved a recurring problem, please write it down.

### 🪶 Light a Campfire

A case study from your institution. **Be specific** – readers want to know what your institution looks like, what you tried, what didn't work, and what you'd do differently. Generic advice goes in Signposts; **lived experience** goes here.

There's a dedicated [case-study template](https://github.com/elixir-europe/ds-handbook/blob/main/pages/case-studies/_TEMPLATE_case_study.md) – copy it into `pages/case-studies/`, fill in the frontmatter, and the page renders an at-a-glance card automatically.

{% include callout.html type="note" content="Some campfire frontmatter fields (scale, domain, themes, country, status) use a controlled vocabulary that lives in `_data/case_study/`. If your case needs a value that isn't listed yet – a new theme, a country we haven't had before – propose it in your PR by adding a line to the relevant YAML, rather than inventing one inline. That keeps filtering and counts consistent across the site." %}

### 🪶 Plant a Waypoint

Propose or refine a maturity indicator. The maturity model lives in the [rdm-maturity-model](https://github.com/elixir-europe/rdm-maturity-model) repository – contributions there flow into this handbook automatically.

### 🪶 Just review

Open any page, hit the GitHub edit link in the metadata block at the bottom, and leave comments on a draft. The most useful reviews ask *"would I know what to do after reading this?"*

## Write in the handbook's voice

The handbook tries to sound like a colleague who's done this before – friendly, plain, practical. Not a policy document, not a research paper. Three rules of thumb:

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="Talk to your future self after a long week. Would the version of you on Friday-at-5pm find this useful, or would you skim past?" %}

1. **Tell us what you actually did.** Don't recite what other resources say. We can link to those. We want *your* take.
2. **Concrete > abstract.** "We held a 30-minute intake call with the PI before each new project" beats "We instituted a stakeholder-engagement protocol".
3. **Don't hide the rough bits.** A campfire that says "this didn't work and here's why" is more useful than one that says "everything went smoothly".

{% include callout.html type="warning" content="Avoid copy-pasting policy text from your institution's intranet. Quote it briefly, link to the source, and tell us what it means in practice." %}

## Reusable components

The handbook has a small set of editorial components you can drop into any page. Use them to give your writing structure and personality.

### Callouts

Five flavours, all spoken by the magpie. Pick the type that matches the *intensity*: `tip` for friendly suggestions, `note` for context, `important` for things that need attention, `warning` for things that can cause real harm, `magpie` for the mascot's voice in general asides.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include callout.html type="tip" content="Skim the campfires for nearest-fit institutions before reinventing the wheel." %}

{% include callout.html type="note" content="The maturity model has three levels per indicator." %}

{% include callout.html type="important" content="Always cite this handbook when adapting its content elsewhere." %}

{% include callout.html type="warning" content="Don't share patient data without DPIA approval, no matter how anonymous it looks." %}

{% include callout.html type="magpie" content="When in doubt, ask the data producer themselves." %}{% endraw %}
```

**Renders as:**

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="Skim the campfires for nearest-fit institutions before reinventing the wheel." %}

{% include callout.html type="note" content="The maturity model has three levels per indicator." %}

{% include callout.html type="important" content="Always cite this handbook when adapting its content elsewhere." %}

{% include callout.html type="warning" content="Don't share patient data without DPIA approval, no matter how anonymous it looks." %}

{% include callout.html type="magpie" content="When in doubt, ask the data producer themselves." %}

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="Use callouts sparingly. A page with one callout reads like a chapter; a page with eight reads like an alarm system." %}

### Drop cap

Open a chapter intro with a Bricolage drop cap – gives the page weight and editorial character.

```html
<p class="drop-cap">First paragraph of your chapter goes here. The first letter renders large in the brand's amber-brick.</p>
```

**Renders as:**

<p class="drop-cap">First paragraph of your chapter goes here. The first letter renders large in the brand's amber-brick. Use this only on the lede paragraph of a chapter – it loses meaning if every section opens with one.</p>

### Section eyebrow

A small mono uppercase eyebrow above a heading – useful for chapter labels and section markers. Tone variants pick up landmark colour: `tone--signposts`, `tone--campfires`, `tone--waypoints`, `tone--amber`.

```html
<p class="section-eyebrow"> TRAIL NOTES</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--signposts"> SIGNPOSTS</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--campfires"> CAMPFIRES</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--waypoints"> WAYPOINTS</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--amber"> AMBER</p>
```

**Renders as:**

<p class="section-eyebrow"> TRAIL NOTES</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--signposts"> SIGNPOSTS</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--campfires"> CAMPFIRES</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--waypoints"> WAYPOINTS</p>
<p class="section-eyebrow tone--amber"> AMBER</p>

### Margin note

A handwritten Caveat aside that sits in the margin. Useful for a tiny detail that would interrupt the main flow.

```html
<aside class="margin-note">A small handwritten aside, like a sticky note.</aside>
```

**Renders as:**

<aside class="margin-note">A small handwritten aside, like a sticky note. Tilted slightly so it feels stuck on, not typeset.</aside>

### Pull quote

For when something a colleague said deserves to stand on its own. Don't use it for your own copy – it's for *quoting*.

```html
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
  <p>The hardest part of data stewardship isn't the data – it's the conversations around the data.</p>
  <cite>A senior data steward, somewhere in Europe</cite>
</blockquote>
```

**Renders as:**

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
  <p>The hardest part of data stewardship isn't the data – it's the conversations around the data.</p>
  <cite>A senior data steward, somewhere in Europe</cite>
</blockquote>

### Saving and printing

Your readers can save any page to **the magpie's nest** (a browser-side reading list), and print the lot as a PDF. You don't need to do anything to enable it – every published chapter gets the bookmark button automatically.



## Crediting contributions

The handbook uses the [CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://credit.niso.org/) so each person's contribution to a chapter is captured precisely – written, reviewed, illustrated, etc. – rather than collapsed into a generic "contributor" label.

The supported CRediT roles in this handbook are:

- **Conceptualization** – overall scope or structure decisions
- **Writing – original draft** – wrote the chapter from scratch
- **Writing – review & editing** – reviewed, edited, or proofread someone else's draft
- **Visualization** – illustrations, diagrams, design
- **Software** – code or tooling that powers the site
- **Project administration** – coordination, herding the project
- **Funding acquisition** – got the grant or institutional support
- **Supervision** – mentored other contributors

### On a page

Use the role-keyed form in the page's frontmatter. Each contributor takes **one role per page**:

```yaml
contributors:
  writing-original-draft: [Aida Moure Fernández]
  writing-review-editing: [Jane Doe, Bob Smith]
  visualization: [Sam Stylist]
```

The flat-list shorthand still works – it's treated as `writing-original-draft`:

```yaml
contributors: [Aida Moure Fernández]   # solo writer
```

### Project-wide contributions

Some people contribute to the handbook as a whole rather than to specific chapters – running the project, getting the grant, designing the site. Those go in `_data/CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` against their entry:

```yaml
Aida Moure Fernández:
  git: aidamouref
  orcid: 0000-0001-8833-5750
  affiliation: Barcelona Supercomputing Center
  roles:
    - project-administration
    - conceptualization
```

The `/contributors` page aggregates *all* of a person's roles – project-wide ones plus every page-level role they've taken – into a single roster entry, so a project lead who's also written three chapters appears with the full set of chips.

{% include callout.html type="note" content="The two writing roles (original draft + review & editing) collapse to a single **Writing** chip on the global `/contributors` roster, to avoid clutter when someone has been an editor on one page and a writer on another. On individual page metadata, the two stay distinct so the role each person played on *that* chapter is clear." %}


## What's out of scope

Some things belong in sister projects:

- **Researcher-facing how-tos** → [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)
- **FAIR principle recipes** → [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/)
- **Data Management Plan templates** → [DSW](https://ds-wizard.org/)
- **Standards / databases / policies registry** → [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/)
- **Training courses and materials** → [TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/)
- **Content for non-steward roles** (DPOs, security officers, funders) → wherever those communities maintain their own resources

When in doubt, link to the existing resource and add the steward-specific context here.

## Submitting a contribution

We work on GitHub. The flow is the standard fork-and-PR:

1. **Fork** the [Data Steward Handbook repository](https://github.com/elixir-europe/ds-handbook) on GitHub.
2. **Add yourself** to `_data/CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` if you're not already there.
3. **Write your page** in the right folder:
   - Signposts → `pages/guidance/`
   - Campfires → `pages/case-studies/`
   - About / meta → `pages/about/`
4. **Add the right front matter** at the top of the file (see existing pages for examples – `title`, `type`, `description`, `contributors`, `page_id` are the minimum). The `contributors` field should credit each person's specific role on this page using [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/) – see *Crediting contributions* below.
5. **Preview your changes** before opening the PR – two options, see below.
6. **Open a Pull Request** against `main`. (GitHub will prompt you to name a branch when you commit, if you haven't already.)
7. **Reviewers** will give feedback. Once two contributors approve, we merge.

{% include callout.html type="note" content="If you're not comfortable with Git, [open an issue](https://github.com/elixir-europe/ds-handbook/issues) describing your contribution. Someone will help turn it into a PR with you." %}

## Previewing your changes

Two ways, depending on how comfortable you are with a terminal.

### Option A – Preview on your fork (no local setup)

If you'd rather not install Ruby/Jekyll, GitHub Pages can build the handbook for you directly from your fork.

1. On your fork, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under *Build and deployment* set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, pick the branch you want to preview (e.g. `main`, or your working branch like `signpost/intake-meetings`) and `/ (root)`. Save.
3. Wait a minute or two for the first build. Your preview lives at:
   `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/ds-handbook/`
4. Edit pages directly in the GitHub web UI (pencil icon on any `.md` file) or push commits from a branch – the fork rebuilds automatically on every push.

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="Builds typically take 30–90 seconds. If a build seems stuck or fails, check the **Actions** tab on your fork – the error message there usually points at the line that broke the build." %}

### Option B – Run it locally

If you've got Ruby installed, you can run the site locally and see changes instantly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elixir-europe/ds-handbook --recurse-submodules
cd ds-handbook
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site is then at `http://localhost:4000`. Sass + Liquid changes hot-reload; theme assets come from the remote [ELIXIR Toolkit Theme](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme).
