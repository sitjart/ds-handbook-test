## Context
Good research data management (RDM) depends on clear communication. Information must not only be shared but also understood and discussed. When researchers are empowered to ask questions and provide feedback, RDM transforms into a collaborative effort rather than merely a set of instructions.

In many organisations, communication still moves in one direction. Guidelines are rarely brought up again and promoted once they have been published. Researchers may not know whom to ask or may expect no reply leading them to feel discouraged from asking. Visible and approachable data stewards can change this by opening channels for dialogue and responding in a timely way. 

A culture of communication shows that RDM is taken seriously. When teams have the space and support to reply, follow up, and act on feedback, it reflects a genuine commitment to improvement. Slow or missing responses often point to a lack of time, unclear roles, or limited awareness. 

Examples from ELIXIR organisations show that effective communication works best when it becomes part of daily routines. Helpdesks, shared inboxes, office hours, or informal meetings such as RDM breakfasts help keep contact alive. These small, steady interactions build trust and keep RDM guidance relevant and current.

## Guidance
RDM communication between data stewards and researchers, administrative, and IT staff determines how well principles and practices are adopted and maintained. The following sections outline what to look out for and what to establish to create a clear and effective flow of RDM communication. They focus on **visibility**, **feedback**, and **integration** into daily work.

### 1\. Visibility of RDM support and communication channels

**✔ Increase presence at the institutional level**

* Become part of the official onboarding and offboarding processes  
* Provide (onboarding) materials, write  welcome emails  
* Provide RDM support content/availability reminders in newsletters or intranet pages  
* Provide hallway posters, roll-outs, and slides at department meetings

**✔ Provide structured points of contact**

* Create a functional email address (e.g. rdm-support@...) and use it for all communication to ensure clarity and continuity.  
* Establish predictable channels for support, such as helpdesks, shared inboxes, or advertised drop-in hours.

**✔ Go where the researchers are**

Join regular activities to stay visible and build trust:

* Lab meetings  
* Working groups  
* Orientation events  
* Social events

**✔ Create a recognisable brand identity**

* Follow a consistent color scheme and style for presentations and other communications  
* Create a recognisable icon

### 2\. Encourage feedback and demonstrate change

**✔ Invite questions proactively**

Include feedback prompts in emails, presentations or onboarding slides to make asking questions feel normal.

**✔ Track what comes in**

Use a simple format to log input and improve consistency over time, such as a shared spreadsheet or form.

**✔ Dedicate time to follow up**

Set aside hours specifically for responding to questions and reflecting on service quality.

**✔ Communicate visible change**

Let researchers know when their input results in updates to templates, guidance or policies. 

**✔ Use patterns to strengthen support**

Recurring questions can highlight unclear guidance or missing resources. Use them to guide improvements.

**✔ Share back through existing channels**

Utilise the channels that researchers already use to share the changes implemented from their feedback. 

### 3\. Embed RDM communication into institutional workflows

**✔ Position support at key moments**

* Align contact points with research milestones such as project registration, data deposit or ethics review.

**✔ Participate in cross-functional structures**

* Ensure an RDM contact person is represented in:  
  * Grant writing teams  
  * Infrastructure planning groups  
  * Research governance meetings
