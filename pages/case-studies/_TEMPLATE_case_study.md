# Case study (campfire) template
# Copy this file into pages/case-studies/<your-case>.md and fill it in.
# Required fields are marked (mandatory). Everything else is optional but
# encouraged – the more you fill in, the more useful the case is to others.
#
# Some fields use a controlled vocabulary – you set a key, and the layout
# looks up the human-readable label from a YAML in _data/case_study/.
# If you need a value that isn't there, propose it in your PR rather than
# inventing one inline (so filtering and counts stay consistent).

## Why this case (mandatory)

What problem or gap did this work address, and why was it worth doing?
Set up enough institutional context that a reader from a different
country or sector can follow.

- What was the situation before?
- Who was affected (researchers, stewards, leadership)?
- Why now – what made this the moment to act?

Two or three short paragraphs. Don't recite policy – tell the story of
the gap. Concrete details (sizes, dates, the specific incident that
triggered it) help more than abstractions.


## What we did (mandatory)

The actual approach. Walk through what you tried, in roughly the order
you tried it. Bring people and tools in as they appear – no need for a
separate "stakeholders" or "tools" section.

- What was the first move?
- Which tools, frameworks, or existing resources did you use? (e.g.
  RDMkit pages, DSW templates, internal SOPs, the FAIR Cookbook)
- How were researchers / leadership / partners engaged at each step?
- Was this brand-new, or built on something existing?
- Roughly how much effort was involved (FTE, calendar time)?

Be concrete. *"We held a 30-minute intake call with the PI before each
new project"* beats *"We instituted a stakeholder-engagement protocol"*.
If you got something wrong and pivoted, say so here – the pivot is part
of the story.


## What changed (encouraged)

What's different now? Concrete outputs are most useful – a training
course delivered, a workflow adopted, a policy written, a tool deployed,
a number that moved.

- What was produced or implemented?
- What's the evidence it worked? (uptake numbers, feedback, metrics,
  anecdotes – all valid; pick what you actually have.)
- What barriers came up, and which factors helped you push through?
  (Leadership backing, an existing community, a deadline, a champion?)

If the work hasn't produced visible change yet, say so – *"too early to
tell, will revisit in 12 months"* is a fine answer when it's honest.
Better than reaching for impact that isn't there.


## What we'd tell others (mandatory)

The lesson, the caveats, the conditions for replication, and what
happens next – bundled because they overlap in practice.

- **What worked, and why.** The one or two things you'd repeat without
  hesitation if you were starting over.
- **What didn't work, and how you adapted.** The corner you painted
  yourself into. Future contributors learn most from these.
- **Transferability and scaling potential.** Can this approach be reused
  by another institution or individual? What conditions are required
  (leadership buy-in, existing service, specific funding, a particular
  legal context)? What adaptations might be needed? Be honest about
  what was special about your setting.
- **Sustainability and next steps.** How is the work currently supported
  or funded? Who maintains or owns it? What are the plans for
  continuation, embedding, or scaling? If continuity is uncertain, say
  so.
