Service Overview
ELIXIR-NL has established a strong foundation for supporting legal and ethical data stewardship through its pioneering ELSI Servicedesk (Ethical, Legal, and Societal Issues). This national resource enables researchers and data stewards to navigate the regulatory landscape for health and life sciences research in the Netherlands.
The Servicedesk offers a tiered model of support:
* A self-service online portal with curated FAQs, templates, and guidance on GDPR, consent, and research ethics.
* Trained ELSI professionals providing tailored, project-specific support for institutions within the Dutch research infrastructure.
* An active collaboration network that includes data stewards, legal officers, institutional DPOs, ethics committees, and international policy groups (e.g., BBMRI, EOSC).
