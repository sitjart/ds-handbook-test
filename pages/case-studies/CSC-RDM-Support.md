Service Overview:

As part of its commitment to enabling secure, FAIR, and legally compliant research, ELIXIR-FI supports researchers working with sensitive data through the national research IT infrastructure provider, CSC. CSC provides a robust suite of services and guidance specifically designed to manage personal, sensitive, and regulated data (including data falling under GDPR, medical confidentiality rules, or national legislation).
These services are tailored to help researchers and data stewards plan, store, share, and process sensitive data responsibly. The support includes technical solutions, policy templates, and hands-on help navigating legal and ethical requirements in Finnish and EU contexts.
