This indicator assesses the extent to which an organisation uses goals and KPIs from its RDM strategy to monitor progress and support improvement. It looks at whether these metrics are clear, regularly reviewed and linked to daily operations. Higher maturity levels show a move from ad hoc or informal tracking to a structured, data-driven approach. This supports accountability, decision making and supports ongoing development of RDM practices.

## Level 1 - No RDM goals nor KPIs defined

* **No strategic framework**: The organisation has no defined goals or performance indicators related to RDM.  
* **Unstructured development**: Activities take place without reference to measurable outcomes or alignment with a broader strategy.  
* **No accountability**: There is no mechanism to assess progress, identify gaps or demonstrate improvement.  
* **Reactive approach**: Any changes in RDM practice occur in response to immediate issues rather than through planned development.

**Impact**: The organisation lacks a clear direction for RDM development. Progress cannot be measured or compared, leading to fragmented efforts and limited strategic growth.

## Level 2 - RDM goals defined without KPIs

* **Strategic intent recognised**: RDM goals are outlined in institutional or organisational strategies but remain high-level and non-measurable.  
* **Qualitative orientation**: Goals describe general intentions (e.g., “improve data sharing” or “promote FAIR practices”) without defining concrete success criteria or timelines.  
* **No measurement tools**: There are no KPIs or performance metrics to evaluate  progress  or determine whether goals are being achieved.

**Impact**: Without measurable indicators, the implementation and impact of the RDM strategy cannot be monitored, evaluated and systematically improved.

## Level 3 - (Some) RDM goals and KPIs defined (but not monitored)

* **Measurable objectives established**: RDM goals are defined in measurable terms and expressed through specific KPIs.  
* **No monitoring process**: While metrics are defined, there is no established mechanism or workflow for tracking progress and evaluating performance.  
* **Potential for alignment**: Common goals support coordination between partners and domains, but the absence of monitoring limits shared learning.

**Impact**: The RDM strategy goals are defined in an unambiguous and measurable way. There is a  common monitoring process of RDM strategy implementation between different members, partners and domains.

## Level 4 - RDM goals defined and monitored via KPIs

* **Active monitoring framework**: The RDM strategy includes clear, measurable goals that are regularly tracked through defined KPIs.  
* **Integrated reporting**: Results are reviewed at organisational and leadership levels to assess performance and inform strategic decisions.  
* **Continuous improvement**: KPI outcomes are used to refine objectives, allocate resources and update the RDM strategy.  
* **Evidence-based culture**: Data-driven evaluation supports transparency, accountability, and shared ownership of RDM progress.

**Impact**: A successful RDM culture is developed, progress is monitored and RDM strategy can be appropriately revised.
