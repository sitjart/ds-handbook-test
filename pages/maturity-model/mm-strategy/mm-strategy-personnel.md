This indicator examines how responsibilities for research data management are distributed and supported within an organisation. It considers the presence, roles and coordination of staff who provide RDM expertise and guidance. Maturity reflects a progression from informal, individual efforts to structured and well-coordinated teams that ensure continuity, quality and long-term sustainability of RDM services.

## Level 1 – No staff has explicit DM duties

* **Unassigned responsibilities**: RDM responsibilities are not formally defined, assigned or recognised within the organisation.  
* **Reactive**: RDM tasks are carried out when the occasion arises, without structure, procedures or clear accountability.  
* **No support**: Researchers rely on informal help, personal experience or external support for RDM questions.

**Impact**: RDM activities are inconsistent and depend entirely on individual initiatives. Knowledge is not retained and institutional responsibility is absent.

## Level 2 – There are staff that have DM duties

* **Partial responsibility**: Some staff include RDM-related tasks in their broader roles but it is not their sole focus.  
* **Informal practice**: Approaches differ across departments and processes are rarely documented.  
* **Low coordination**: Communication between staff performing RDM duties is limited or non-existent.  
* **Emerging awareness**: The value of RDM is recognised but roles and priorities are still unclear.

**Impact**: RDM support is beginning to develop but remains fragmented and unsustainable. Success depends on individual motivation rather than organisational structure.

## Level 3 – There are dedicated DM staff

* **Defined roles**: Specific staff have RDM as their primary responsibility, supported by clear job descriptions.  
* **Regular support**: RDM staff provide structured support, training and guidance to researchers.  
* **Growing collaboration** – Data stewards and related roles begin to share knowledge and align practices.

**Impact**: RDM support is consistent and professional, but coordination across the organisation is still limited and services may vary in scope or coverage.

## Level 4 – There is a dedicated DM coordination team

* **Formal structure**: Dedicated RDM staff are organised into a recognised coordination team.  
* **Harmonised activities**: Roles, workflows and communication are aligned across departments and services.  
* **Strategic role**: The team contributes to policy development, planning and continuous improvement of RDM practices.  
* **Embedded culture**: RDM responsibilities are part of institutional strategy and professional development pathways.

**Impact**: RDM support is cohesive, sustainable and strategically embedded in the organisation’s research environment. Coordination ensures efficiency, shared learning and long-term institutional growth.
