This indicator assesses the stability, diversity and sustainability of funding that  supports the implementation, maintenance and continuous improvement of RDM services. Maturity reflects the organisation’s capacity to ensure that RDM resources are planned against funding changes.

## Level 1 – No specific funding

* **No allocated resources**: RDM activities rely on individual initiative or temporary, ad-hoc arrangements and are performed informally alongside other duties without dedicated support.  
* **No budget for infrastructure**: There is no designated funding for RDM tools, infrastructure or staff roles, limiting the ability to establish or maintain services.

**Impact:** RDM services are fragmented and inconsistent, with progress depending on individual initiative rather than organisational support.

## Level 2 – Funding from individual grant-based project or minimal stable funding (annual allowance)

* **Project-dependent support** : RDM services or infrastructure are funded primarily through individual project grants or small annual allocations, resulting in variation in service availability depending on active funded projects.  
* **Limited continuity**: Funding is temporary, uncertain or insufficient to support growth or long-term planning.

**Impact:** Some RDM capabilities exist, but development is limited and continuity is uncertain when project-based funding ends.

## Level 3 – Large stable funding or combination of grant-based and stable funding

* **Stable core funding**: Essential RDM services, infrastructure and key staff roles are supported by ongoing institutional funding. Grant-based funding is used to enhance or extend capabilities rather than to sustain core operations.  
* **Resilient infrastructure:** Service provision is consistent across the organisation and remains stable even when grant funding changes.

**Impact:** RDM support is reliable and sustained, enabling coordinated strategic development and institution-wide adoption of practices.

##  Level 4 – Combination of grant-based, stable funding and detailed cost recovery model

* **Sustained core funding**: Stable institutional funding ensures continuity of essential services and staffing.  
* **Strategic enhancement**: Grant funding is used proactively to drive innovation, expand capabilities or pilot new services.  
* **Cost recovery model**: Service fees or shared-cost models supplement funding, supporting scalability and long-term financial sustainability.

**Impact:** RDM infrastructure is strategically planned, financially sustainable and continuously improved through diversified and resilient funding streams.
