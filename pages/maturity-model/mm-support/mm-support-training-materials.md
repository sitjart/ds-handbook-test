This indicator assesses the availability of RDM training materials, including their accessibility, openness, discoverability, and potential for reuse. It captures whether materials exist, how they are organised, who can access them, and the impact in and/or outside institutions. Availability affects efficiency, consistency, recognition, and alignment with FAIR principles.

## Level 1 – Not available
* **No materials produced:** RDM training is delivered without reusable materials. The materials are closed, not openly shared and/or saved. 
* **No central storage or access:** Training content is neither archived centrally nor easily discoverable by staff or partners.
* **No discoverability:** Materials are not indexed, linked, or promoted.
* **No reuse intent:** There’s no awareness of licensing or repurposing value.

**Impact:** Training remains isolated and created just for one occasion. Reuse is impossible, and knowledge is not retained beyond individual sessions. Knowledge sharing relies on the responsibility of participants.

## Level 2 – Available on request
* **Ad hoc sharing:** Materials are shared only when someone requests them.
* **Limited and unstructured access:** Training materials are scattered across personal drives or unstructured folders, with no central repository, catalogue, or clear way for staff to locate them.
* **Passive availability:** No central access; staff must know whom to contact to get the training materials.
* **No reuse conditions:** Missing licensing and citation information, or permission guidance.
* **Unrealised openness:** There is intent to share the training materials more widely, but no process is in place.

**Impact:** The materials exist but are underutilised. Others cannot find or reuse them without insider knowledge. Visibility remains very low.

## Level 3 – Accessible to staff and partners only
* **Restricted internal access:** Materials are shared via intranet or internal learning systems and are only available to registered or internal users.
* **Organised access:** Some indexing or archiving exists by course, topic, etc.
* **Partial reuse:** Staff reuse materials for internal sessions or project needs.
* **Minimal metadata:** Files often lack clear licensing, versioning, or authorship.
* **Unclear maintenance:** Updates depend on individual initiative.

**Impact:** Training can be reused within the institution, increasing internal efficiency. However, materials remain hidden from the wider research community and do not contribute to broader capacity building.

## Level 4 – Open, multilingual/English and widely promoted
* **Open-access platforms:** Content is published on TeSS, GitHub, Zenodo, or similar platforms.
* **Clear licensing:** Reuse is supported through Creative Commons or an equivalent license.
* **Multilingual or English provision:** English versions are provided; local languages may be added upon request.
* **Active promotion:** Channels such as newsletters, training portals, and registries are utilised.
* **Maintained and versioned:** Regular reviews and updates are built into workflows.
* **Indexed and linked:** Content is registered in community platforms or institutional catalogues.

**Impact:** Training materials are reusable and citable, widely visible, and can be shared across institutions and borders, strengthening both adoption and institutional reputation.
