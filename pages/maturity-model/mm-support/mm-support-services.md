This indicator assesses how well RDM services are established, documented and supported across the organisation. It considers whether researchers can rely on consistent, connected tools and processes throughout the data lifecycle. Maturity increases as institutions move from ad hoc, isolated services to coordinated and professionally managed infrastructures.

## Level 1 – Services present but only informally supported
* **Fragmented coverage:** Some services, such as storage or data transfer, exist but they are disconnected and inconsistent. The complete infrastructure to support the entire data lifecycle is missing.
* **No clear ownership:** Responsibilities are undefined, and documentation is missing or outdated.
* **Ad hoc support:** Researchers depend on colleagues or trial-and-error to solve issues.

**Impact:** Service quality is uneven and researchers risk losing data or duplicating work.

## Level 2 – Services formally supported and documented
* **Defined responsibilities:** Each service has an identified owner and a basic governance structure.
* **Documented procedures:** Working instructions, templates and how-to guides are available and up to date.
* **Formal access to support:** Users can report issues or request help through an established contact or channel.

**Impact:** Services are visible and documented, but coverage and coordination remain limited. Researchers know where to go for help, yet support may rely on individual initiative.

## Level 3 – Professional service provision with ticketing system, usage agreements, formal documents, templates, etc; relevant services are integrated with each other
* **Structured governance:** Roles, workflows, and accountability are clear and coordinated.
* **Connected systems:** Key services (e.g., storage, metadata, preservation and sharing) work together under a shared framework.
* **Continuous improvement:** Feedback, ticketing and usage data inform regular updates and staff planning.

**Impact:** The RDM infrastructure is reliable, trusted and sustainable. Researchers obtain consistent, well-managed support throughout the data lifecycle.
