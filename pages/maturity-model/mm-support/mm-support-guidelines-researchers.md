This indicator assesses whether researchers can easily find, understand, and rely on written RDM guidance. It considers the visibility, clarity, maintenance, and communication of materials such as policies, DMP templates, metadata standards, file naming conventions, and consent procedures. The focus is not on service provision and supporting infrastructure, nor on communication and responsiveness, but on whether guidance is available, usable, and discoverable without having to ask.

## Level 1 – None
* **No written RDM guidance:** Materials are not available or easily findable.
* **No central location:** There are no links to internal or external resources.
* **No practical materials:** Templates, examples, and step-by-step instructions are missing.
* **No support system in place:** Researchers rely entirely on informal, ad hoc peer-to-peer support.

**Impact:** Researchers work without clear direction, leading to inconsistent practice, duplicated effort, and non-compliance.

## Level 2 – Unclear and hard to find
* **Scattered guidance:** Guidance materials exist but are scattered across multiple locations.
* **Outdated content:** Materials are outdated or incomplete.
* **No ownership/responsibility:** Responsibility for updates and quality control is not defined/assigned. 
* **Limited scope:** Coverage is limited to a few topics, often in inaccessible language.

**Impact:** Resources remain underused or distrusted, resulting in avoidable demands on staff time.

## Level 3 – Partially available
* **Central entry point:** A central hub exists, covering key RDM topics.
* **Irregular updates:** Updates of the materials happen occasionally, but without a fixed schedule.
* **Uneven coverage:** Coverage of RDM topics is uneven, with some topics missing or underdeveloped.
* **Partial integration:** Guidance is occasionally referenced in training or onboarding.

**Impact:** Researchers can find some guidance, but gaps and irregular updates limit trust and uptake.

## Level 4 – Clearly visible and maintained
* **Comprehensive platform:** A single, well-structured platform or site covers the full research lifecycle.
* **Regularly updated:** Guidance is regularly updated, timestamped, and versioned on a set schedule.
* **Active promotion:** Information is actively promoted across multiple institutional channels.
* **Integrated access:** Linked from library, ethics, IT, and research portals for maximum visibility.

**Impact:** Researchers encounter trusted, relevant, and well-maintained guidance early and often, reducing reliance on ad hoc support and enabling consistent good practice.
