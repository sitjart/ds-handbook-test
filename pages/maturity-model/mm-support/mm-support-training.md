This indicator assesses the availability, structure and sustainability of RDM training within an organisation. It looks at whether training is offered regularly, targeted to specific audiences and supported by institutional resources. Maturity reflects a shift from ad hoc, individual-led efforts to coordinated, ongoing programmes embedded in organisational processes.

## Level 1 – No RDM training offered to staff
* **No planned training:** Sessions are either absent or held only informally and on an irregular basis.
* **No dedicated responsibility:** Responsibility of planning and undertaking the training  lies with individuals without a formal mandate.
* **No structure or content:** Materials, if available, are informal, incomplete or lack clear objectives, and are not preserved for future use.
* **No tracking:** Attendance or learning outcomes are not recorded.

**Impact:** Skills development absent or inconsistent and largely dependent on individual initiative. Institutional knowledge is easily lost.

## Level 2 – Ad-hoc RDM training provided, no or limited targeted approach
* **Limited scope:** Training takes place occasionally or focuses narrowly on specific tools, policies or projects only.
* **Dependent on short-term effort:** Driven by individual enthusiasm, urgent needs or project funding.
* **Materials not maintained:** Content is often outdated or not systematically shared and preserved.
* **Low visibility:** Awareness among target audiences is limited.

**Impact:** Some staff benefit from targeted sessions, but coverage is patchy and momentum is difficult to maintain.

## Level 3 – Regular training and/or broad audience reach with targeted contents
* **Recurring schedule:** Training is offered at predictable intervals to defined audiences.
* **Curated materials:** Content is maintained, updated, aligned with recognised standards and, where relevant, connected to complementary resources.
* **Feedback loop:** Participant input is collected and used to refine training.
* **Supported delivery:** A small team or network of trainers shares responsibility.

**Impact:** Skills and practices are reinforced over time, with training recognised as a standard part of professional development.

## Level 4 – Structured program and train-the-trainer is made available to internal trainers
* **Embedded in workflows:** Training is part of onboarding, doctoral schools or regular staff development.
* **Multiple formats:** Online, in-person, e-learning and blended delivery ensure accessibility.
* **Capacity building:** Train-the-Trainer programmes expand delivery capability for internal trainers.
* **Formal recognition:** Participation counts toward certificates, ECTS or career progression.

**Impact:** Training is a well-established, valued component of research culture, supporting widespread and sustained adoption of RDM best practices.
