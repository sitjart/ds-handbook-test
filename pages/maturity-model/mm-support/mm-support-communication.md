This indicator assesses how well RDM communication works across an organisation. It focuses on whether researchers can ask questions, provide feedback, and receive timely, useful answers. The level of maturity reflects a shift from one-way announcements to open, two-way exchange supported by visible and trusted RDM staff. 

## Level 1 – One-way and slow
* **Top-down communication:** Information is shared without space for feedback.
* **No designated contact:** Researchers do not know where to direct their questions.
* **Little or no follow-up:** Feedback is rare or unanswered.
* **Invisible support:** RDM staff are unknown or disconnected from research activities.

**Impact:** Communication is passive and untrusted. Researchers work in isolation and remain unaware of available support.

## Level 2 – Some feedback and interaction
* **Partial feedback loop:** Questions or comments are possible but not always addressed.
* **Inconsistent response:** Quality and speed of replies vary.
* **Informal structure:** Communication depends on personal contacts or individual effort.
* **Limited visibility:** Existing channels are not well-known or regularly used.

**Impact:** Communication is possible but inconsistent. Responses depend on individuals rather than an organised system.

## Level 3 – Responsive and two-way
* **Dedicated communication channels:** Helpdesks, shared inboxes, or office hours are available and easy to access.
* **Consistent follow-up:** Questions are logged, answered, and revisited when needed.
* **Visible and active RDM staff:** Data stewards take part in meetings, training, and onboarding.
* **Feedback integration:** User input results in updates in guidance, templates, or services.

**Impact:** Communication is open and trusted. RDM becomes part of daily research practice, and feedback helps shape continuous improvement.
