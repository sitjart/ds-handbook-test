## What this indicator measures
This indicator assesses the quality, direction, and responsiveness of RDM-related communication in an organisation or Node. It looks at whether researchers can ask questions, provide feedback, and receive timely, helpful answers. Maturity reflects a shift from top-down, static information to dynamic, two-way dialogue supported by trusted, visible RDM professionals.

## Maturity levels

### Level 1 – One-way and slow
* Top-down only – Policies or updates are shared without feedback mechanisms.
* No designated contact – Researchers don’t know where to direct questions.
* Invisible support – RDM staff are unknown or disconnected.
* Impact: RDM communication is unidirectional and untrusted. Researchers are uninformed or disengaged.

### Level 2 – Some feedback and interaction
* Bidirectional potential – Staff can ask questions, but only some are addressed.
* Uneven responses – Timeliness and quality vary greatly.
* Partial visibility – A few contacts are known, but awareness is limited.
* Impact: Communication is possible but unpredictable. It depends on individuals, not structures.

### Level 3 – Responsive and two-way
* Dedicated channels – Helpdesks, email addresses, or live sessions are in place.
* Timely follow-up – Input from users is consistently addressed.
* Visible support – Data stewards are clearly named and present in relevant forums.
* Impact: Dialogue is normalised and trusted. Communication improves both services and research culture.
