This indicator assesses whether and how RDM professionals within an organisation are engaged in expert networks (locally, nationally, and internationally) and the extent to which their institution supports their participation. Such networks are vital for sharing expertise, aligning practices, building capacity, and driving collaborative innovation. Support for networking reflects institutional maturity; not just whether individuals participate, but whether such engagement is structurally enabled, resourced, and encouraged.

## Level 1 – Only internal interaction
* **No structured participation:** There are no formal connections to RDM networks.
* **Isolation of roles:** Individual RDM staff work alone without peer support.
* **No encouragement from leadership:** Engagement in broader communities is neither valued nor supported.
* **Local-only focus:** Activities stay within institutional boundaries, lacking external visibility.

**Impact:** Expertise remains trapped in silos, leading to inefficiency, low visibility, and limited innovation.

## Level 2 – Informal interaction with external RDM experts
* **Occasional contact:** Some staff engage with networks informally or at their own initiative.
* **Unstructured and unfunded:** Participation is ad hoc, often in personal time or using project budget.
* **No defined outcomes:** Engagement remains largely passive; institutions do not expect feedback or demonstrable results or outcomes from participation.

**Impact:** Informal peer learning exists, but institutional knowledge does not accumulate, nor is it formally documented. Engagement depends on individual initiative.

## Level 3 – Established network participation
* **Recognised engagement:** Network participation is acknowledged and partly supported.
* **Some internal coordination:** Peer groups or contact points exist to track involvement.
* **Emerging value:** Shared learning or updates begin to improve institutional practices.

**Impact:** Service quality and staff development improve, but sustained value still relies on motivated individuals.






## Level 4 – Formal institutional support
* **Structural enablement:** Time, travel, and budget are formally allocated for participation.
* **Embedded strategy:** Policies or expectations guide consistent network engagement.
* Feedback and recognition – Network insights are integrated, and contributions valued in roles and reviews.
* Impact: Networking becomes a strategic tool for institutional learning and leadership in the wider RDM ecosystem.
