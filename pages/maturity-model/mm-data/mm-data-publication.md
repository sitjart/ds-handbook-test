This indicator assesses the organisation's readiness and capacity to provide guidelines, standards and best practices for the publication of research data. It also considers the availability of support mechanisms such as training, consultancy or infrastructure that enable researchers to make their data discoverable, accessible and reusable.

## Level 1 – No guideline present or recommended for research data publication

* **No guidelines:** Researchers and staff handling research data have no clear directions on preferred ways for research data publication, licensing and other questions.
* **No dedicated staff:** There is no dedicated staff to advise and support researchers with preparing research data for publishing and choosing appropriate channels.

**Impact:** Research data publication practices are inconsistent and ad hoc, leading to low visibility, limited reuse and potential non-compliance with funder or policy requirements.

## Level 2 – Reference to generic best practices of research data publication

* **Some guidelines exist:** Institutional web pages mention research data publishing and provide links to external resources available for interested researchers and staff.
* **No clear best practice guidance:** While staff is aware of the topic, the in-house know-how is limited and support on specific questions researchers may have is still not available.

**Impact:** Researchers have access to basic external resources but lack practical and context-specific support. Data publication quality and compliance vary and FAIR principles are not consistently applied.

## Level 3 - Specific guidelines and standards are provided regarding data and metadata

* **Clear guidelines exist:** The minimal required metadata for describing research data are clearly defined. Guidance is available for selecting suitable repositories for data publication. The criteria for choosing appropriate licences are described in a clear and actionable way. 
* **Practical support:** Practical support is available to researchers. Data stewards or other support staff have sufficient expertise in publishing research data and can advise researchers effectively.
* **Institutional collaboration:** Networks and mechanisms are in place to support researchers working with personal or sensitive data. These structures help them navigate publisher and funder requirements while ensuring data subject rights where relevant.

**Impact:** Researchers receive clear and practical advice on metadata, citation, licensing and access. They can publish data with greater confidence and consistency. This leads to higher data quality, improved discoverability and better alignment with FAIR and legal standards.

## Level 4 - Research data publication follows a standardised, documented process and support is available

* **Standardised process:** Research data publication follows a documented institutional workflow that integrates key elements such as citation via personal identifiers, repository selection, metadata validation, licensing and long-term preservation.
* **Comprehensive support:** Dedicated RDM and legal staff provide hands-on assistance through the publication lifecycle, from planning and preparing data according to the DMP to ensuring that permissions, ethical considerations and licensing requirements are met.
* **Quality assurance:** Established review and validation procedures ensure data quality, interoperability (through standard formats and ontologies) and legal compliance. Access types and retention periods are systematically managed.

**Impact:** Research data publication is consistent, reliable and compliant with institutional, legal and FAIR standards. Data are citable, discoverable and reusable, strengthening the organisation’s contribution to open and transparent research.
