This indicator assesses the level of data protection compliance in an organisation and the implementation of roles and systems that ensure responsible handling of research data. It evaluates how effectively data protection principles are embedded into research data management through the Data Protection Officer and mechanisms such as the Registry of Processing Activities (ROPA), consent management and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs). Higher maturity levels reflect a shift from reactive compliance toward a systematic,well-governed approach supported by  leadership, audits and proactive DPO engagement.

### Special cases
In some instances, legal services are outsourced or bought in. In this case, the maturity levels are not scored as 1; they can either be evaluated on the level of the umbrella organisation or marked ‘not applicable’.
