This indicator assesses at what level the strategy for RDM services and activities has been defined and implemented.

## Level 1 - No RDM strategy is defined

   * The organisation has not defined a strategy for its RDM activities. 

   * _Impact_: RDM activities may occur, but are usually uncoordinated and without clear objectives at the organization level.

## Level 2 - Initial RDM strategy planned or drafted

   * The organisation is constructing or planning a strategy 

   * _Impact_: The importance of an RDM strategy for the activities is acknowledged, and work has started to formulate it. 

## Level 3 - RDM strategy approved and published for the organisation.

   * The objectives and how to reach them (missions), including the resources involved are established.

   * The RDM strategy is available to all members of the organisation through an internal channel, but not actively communicated.

   * _Impact_: The RDM objectives are clear, so that activities can be aligned within the organisation. This will improve efficiency and remove potential  redundant activities. The strategy is available to all members of the organization, but there is no further communication,  to build a common understanding of the RDM strategy and work towards a coordinated effort for RDM inside the organization.

## Level 4 - RDM strategy is actively communicated and part of the mandatory onboarding for relevant staff/stakeholders

   * The RDM strategy is actively communicated to all members of the organisation, and is a formal component of onboarding for all new researchers/staff, especially those handling data.

   * _Impact_: Increased awareness of the RDM strategy enabling  a high-level of RDM maturity in the organization

## Level 5 - RDM strategy fully implemented with regular revisions

   * There are activities in place to work towards all objectives, and the objectives and activities are regularly reviewed and re-assessed

   * _Impact_: RDM activities are aligned within the organisation and performed more efficiently.
